# arduino-piano
Code to make an arduino piano that can play more than 1 note at once!

Credit where credit is due- the basis of this code was taken from a response to my question on the Arduino forums:

Thank you to @BlackFin for this amazing code!

This uses this arduino Tone library, so you'll need to install that first.

I was usinig the ATMEGA 328 chip on my arduino and only had 2 speakers to work with, but you could definitely modify this to play more notes if you use a ATMEGA 1280 on your arduino
